## I. High-Level

**Subject:**

- The most effective/optimized methodologies for developing a custom ontological reasoner with forward chaining rules in rust.
- The ideal strategy for iterative development of this type of system.
- Finding/addressing the potential practicality/feasibility limitations of the theoretical system.
- Creating a timeline and batching components/rulesets for developing "rule modules" that can be worked on/adjusted independently.
- Managing a project of this scale, finding new developers, and ensuring the project remains feasibly productive for long-term market deployment as a SAAS.

**Candidates:**

- Kevin Sharp, Director of Research & Professor (Philosophy, UIUC), kscharp@illinois.edu
- Ryan Cunningham, Professor (Computer Science, UIUC), rcunnin2@illinois.edu

## II. Low-Level

**Subject:**

- The history of ontologies/ontological reasoners.
- The reason for the dropoff in popularity, presence, and modernization of ontological technologies past 2000.
- The practicality of using ontological technology for mitigating the occurence of hallucinations in an intelligence system that leverages language models.
- Whether to house the neural/symbolic intelligence components as integrated systems or build the symbolic component into the neural component (and how that would be done).
- The prevalence of using ontological reasoning alongside natural language processors, and the potential utility value of such integration.
